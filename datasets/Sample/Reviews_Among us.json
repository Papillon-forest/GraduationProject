My second thought is could you make teams where your on different teams up to 3 people And you could choose free for all or teams but 1 team would be the imposters and other teams could chat to each other and help each other. And could you make a imposter chat.And can you make when the lights get sabotaged they would have a flashlight. It would be nicer if you could bring back where you don’t have to have a account to make your name. If you made the things happen it will be nice and everyone would be happy.",

We also have levels now too in among us. I am level 30 in among us and working on the snowflake cosmicube. One thing among us should definitely add though is that after a game of among us ends it shows all the players and their roles. That way when the game ends I don’t know who the inpostors are or scientist, engineer, and etc. This would really help a lot and I think a lot of players would agree! Also I don’t know if among us added friends but if not please add friends list so I can friend others! Thank you for listening and have a good day! 12/30/21 (I will add more if I think among us should add something or remove)",

The shapeshifter, engineer and scientist update is the best update the creators came up with. Honestly grateful for it. They even gave us the outfits we had to buy before. Its also worth paying for stars.. not just to look good but to have fun with your fits.  The cosmiccubes are also really cool. I havent had this much fun playing a game everyday since roblox (roblox is still OG and the best game, LEGENDARY status). I believe among us will reach legendary status one day.",

Not sure if it’s just me, but I can’t play the new Airship map. When the game starts, my whole screen goes black, then the game crashes and it kicks me out of the game. Also, when I play in other maps, I disconnect out of the game for absolutely no reason. I don’t see why this could be happening. I’ve downloaded Among Us on my phone and it seems to be working perfectly fine. My main in on my iPad, so maybe this issue has to do with something about that? Not sure. But overall, great game, but please fix this issue if you can. It’s part of the reason I’m trying to link my account to my phone. I can’t seem to figure it out. If it all possible, please respond to this review. I really want some feedback. Sincerely, An Among Us Player.",
