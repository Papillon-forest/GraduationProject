   "text": "Although this game can be fun at times, it’s greatest flaws are the pay to play features, and it’s constant demand for you to give it your all. What do I mean by that? Well there are seasonal Pokémon, Pokémon that only come out during certain times of the year and legendaries that come out once or twice one year. Not a year, but once. It makes it difficult for returning players to get back in the grind set. If you miss a community day you may not see that Pokémon again. And if a Pokémon is only exclusive to raids you can only have one free raid a day, so you’re stuck with whichever iv you get. That is unless you pony up the cash to buy another raid pass. Another issue this game is how much internet it demands. I have a iPhone 11, running it at low settings yet CSGO runs at 120 fps on the same internet without lag, but a master league battle buffers for 5 seconds after each charge move. The lag is so bad that it seems to give opponents 3 shields and causes your own shields to fail. The PVP aspect needs to be patched severely. Overall I think I’ll keep the cycle of only installing this game when something interesting happens because frankly this game wants too much from the player, whether or not it’s asking for grind or for money, I’m done supporting this game. Hopefully you’ll make a wise decision and go invest on another game that rewards your time and effort.",

I was given a long list of extremely detailed questions about an account that I had SIX YEARS AGO…ridiculous. The worst part is was the fact that they had no care for your situation and only about doing the minimum they’re required to do and didn’t care that I showed a VIDEO OF ME LOGGING INTO THE ACCOUNT as I was stopped from logging in. This by far is one of the worst support teams I’ve ever had to deal with. I’ve had other really bad experiences with the support team in which I never was given a shiny pokemon that I caught after a raid which i only received a compensation of a raid pass which doesn’t justify for what happened to me. I’m fed up with it.",

And the only way to actually get a good amount of poke balls is to pay for them, or go to poke stops. (Which doesn’t usually have a lot anyways) So at that point, you can’t really make much progress without paying.",
