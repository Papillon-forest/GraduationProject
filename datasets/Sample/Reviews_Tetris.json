   "text": "This app may have some potential, but it’s nowhere near complete. The ads are the kind of intrusive I’ve come to expect from suspicious apps made by small, foreign developers and don’t implement any obvious forms of security (e.g., no use of the well-established AdSense platform). Of course, despite the oversight in security, the arbitration clause in the ToS is airtight; clearly written by a decent lawyer on retainer. The app itself plays like a beta, with occasional glitches and seemingly rushed UI elements. On the subject of UI, everything about this app is TINY. You basically need a magnifying glass to tell what you’re doing. The whole experience feels like a step backwards since the release of Tetris 2011.Bottom line:I’ll be removing this app from my phone and wouldn’t recommend it to others. It does not implement any obvious security, is presented in a manner that feels like an early work in progress, and contains a lengthy arbitration clause in the ToS that reeks of bad faith.",

The field was clear and large, next/held pieces were large, and the next next piece had its background colored to match the piece. You could immediately tell via that color in the corner of your eye which piece was next. It was a perfect Tetris for basic Marathon play. This release by N3twork, on the other hand, is garbage. Why are the pieces pseudo-3d? Who wants that? Why is the field so tiny, with an inch and a half of dead space above it? Why are the held and next pieces so tiny? Why are they so pale that you can barely distinguish them by color? Everything about this is a regression from EA’s release. Gotta keep the wheels of capitalism grinding somehow, eh, Pajitnov? Everyone involved in this should be ashamed. I hope N3twork’s Tetris Royale isn’t such a shoddy mess.",

While it visually looks great with its themes, it’s aesthetic and more, it sorta feels too simple, and lacking in generalIn EA’s Tetris, you could previously choose a starting level and you were able to save your game so you can continue later. Sadly this game does not have these features, as I often find myself quitting the game to continue later with EA’s Tetris. It would be really nice if you guys could add these features in a future update, developers.Another thing that slightly bugs me, is the aesthetic of being extremely simple. While the interface looks pretty cool in general, stuff that makes me slightly bothered are the lack of total lines cleared, seeing detailed stats at the end of your game, being able to change game options mid-game, and a quick restart button.N3TWORK developers, if it’s possible to add the features listed here in a future update, that would be great, and I’d probably raise my rating to 5 stars.",
