Those I did have to use I had gained in-game without money just through playing. However, once I got to about level 161, the ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù of the puzzles changed dramatically. What I mean is that they are actively put against you and unless you buy in-game currency or power-ups, you are essentially confined to rolling the dice over and over again until the setup is finally in a favorable-enough position to let you win after having tried on the same puzzle for 20 rounds.From my perspective, it‚Äôs clear the game wants to get you dependent on it by giving easier puzzles, and then makes them so impossibly difficult that you are essentially forced to fork out cash to make the game viable again.",
